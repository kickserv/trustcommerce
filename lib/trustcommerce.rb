# [TrustCommerce](http://www.trustcommerce.com) is a payment gateway providing credit card
# processing and recurring / subscription billing services.
#
# This library provides a simple interface to create, edit, delete, and query subscriptions
# using TrustCommerce.
#
# ## Background ##
#
# TrustCommerce's recurring / subscription billing solution is implemented through a service
# called [Citadel](http://www.trustcommerce.com/citadel.php).  A Citadel-enabled account is
# required to use the subscription-based features implemented by this library.
#
# ### Citadel Basics ###
#
# * Citadel stores customer profiles which can include credit card information and billing frequency.
# * Citadel will automatically bill customers on their respective schedules.
# * Citadel identifies each customer by a Billing ID (six-character alphanumeric string).
# * A customer's profile, credit card, and billing frequency can be modified using the Billing ID.
#
# ## Installation ##
#
# The simple way:
#
#     $ sudo gem install trustcommerce
#
# Directly from repository:
#
#     $ svn co svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/trustcommerce/trunk trustcommerce
#
# It is highly recommended to download and install the
# [TCLink ruby extension](http://www.trustcommerce.com/tclink.php).
# This extension provides failover capability and enhanced security features.
# If this library is not installed, standard POST over SSL will be used.
#
# ## Configuration ##
#
# When you signup for a TrustCommerce account you are issued a custid and a password.
# These are your credentials when using the TrustCommerce API.
#
#     TrustCommerce.custid   = '123456'
#     TrustCommerce.password = 'topsecret'
#
#     # optional - sets Vault password for use in query() calls
#     TrustCommerce.vault_password = 'supersecure'
#
# The password that TrustCommerce issues never changes or expires when used through the TCLink
# extension.  However if you choose to use SSL over HTTP instead (the fallback option if the TCLink
# library is not installed), be aware that you need to set the password to your Vault password.
# Likewise, if your application uses the query() method you must set the vault_password.
# The reason is that TrustCommerce currently routes these query() calls through the vault
# and therefore your password must be set accordingly.  To make matters more complicated,
# TrustCommerce currently forces you to change the Vault password every 90 days.
